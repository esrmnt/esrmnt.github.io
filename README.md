# Esrmnt (GitHub Pages)

A super-minimal blog theme inspired by Bear Blog. Works with native GitHub Pages (no plugins required).

## Quick start

1. Create a new repo named `<your-username>.github.io`.
2. Download and unzip this starter, then push its contents to that repo.
3. In the repo settings, enable GitHub Pages if needed (it should auto-publish from main).

Edit `_config.yml` to set your title, author, and URL. Write posts in `_posts/` as `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` with front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "My first post"
---
```

That's it.
