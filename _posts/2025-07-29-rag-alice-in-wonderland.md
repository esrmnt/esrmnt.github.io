### Time to Code: Python and I Need to Get Reacquainted

Now that I've covered the basics, it's time to write some actual code to set up a RAG system. And apparently, the majority of libraries I see for indexing, embedding, retrieval, and all the other RAG essentials are nudging me toward Python.

This isn't exactly a problem per se, but the last Python code I wrote was when version 2.7 was still a thing. No, I'm not that old â€” I just ventured into the world of .NET and never looked back. Until now.

So fair warning: the code is likely to be a bit rusty to begin with, probably sprinkled with the occasional C# habit that doesn't translate well. But I figure I'll be able to polish things up as I go along. How tricky could it be ?

Let's see what rusty Python skills combined with ambitious RAG goals can produce. This should be interesting.

### What's Coming Up

I'll start setting up the development environment and diving into the actual implementation. Time to dust off those Python skills and hope muscle memory kicks in faster than my imposter syndrome does.

Stay tuned for what I'm sure will be a perfectly smooth transition back to Python... right?
