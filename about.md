# Hey there 👋, I'm Nitish  

Welcome to my corner of the internet.  

By day, I’m an **Integration Specialist** (fancy words for: I make sure your apps and systems talk to each other without starting a fight). By night, I’m usually an **avid reader**, tinkerer of tech ideas, and sometimes a philosopher over beer.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Do
I’ve spent over a decade helping businesses untangle their systems and connect the dots.  
Right now, I work as an **IDT Advisor**, building and maintaining enterprise integrations that make data flow smoother than Bangalore traffic (well, almost).  

Some of my playgrounds include: Integrations, designing patterns, solving puzzles, and sometimes, breaking things just to fix them better. I’ve also collected a few shiny badges along the way — proof that people occasionally think I’m doing a decent job.
